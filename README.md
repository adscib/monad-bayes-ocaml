# OCaml version of monad-bayes

This is a sketch of an OCaml implementation of the [monad-bayes](https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes) library described in [Functional programming for modular Bayesian inference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236778). It's not particularly usable and likely the code is broken. It's also not under active development, but I'm sharing it for people who want to play with it.
